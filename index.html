    <h1> Comparing Top Public Universities in Florida </h1>
      <p> By Kierra Hill </p>

<div id="text"
    <p>It's hard to choose which university to attend. If it were up to parents the choice would be simple.
      Ultimately, most parents care about two things: their child's safety and the cost of the education.
      For many students in Florida, staying in state is the only logical option because of the in-state scholarships available to these students.
      Many students will choose between four of the most popular universities in Florida: University of Florida, Florida State University, University of Central Florida, and University of South Florida
  </p>

  <h2>Cost</h2>
  <p>The cost difference between universities can be the deciding factor for many students and their families on which school to further their education at.
    </p>
  <p>This chart illustrates the difference in price at four top Florida public universities according to the family net income. The net income of the family is important because it is more likely a student will recieve aid either from the university or from the government in lower levels of income as compared to higher levels of income.
    </p>
  <p>The data in this chart could be analyzed to prove that these universities can be ranked on average across all income from highest cost to lowest cost, or vice versa.
    The university with the highest net price is the University of Central Florida, followed by Florida State University, the University of South Florida, and the University of Florida.

  <h2>Crime</h2>
  <p> Sending your child away where you cannot offer any protection or guidance is terrifying. Making sure you are sending them to a relatively safe school can bring some comfort and peace of mind.
    </p>
  <p> This chart illustrates criminal offenses on campus of the same four universities that were compared in price above. Rather than simply comparing these universities we can see whether criminal offenses on campus are increasing or decreasing over time. After all, a university is most often a four year commitment so looking at trends in the data could be the best way to predict what will be happening in later years.
